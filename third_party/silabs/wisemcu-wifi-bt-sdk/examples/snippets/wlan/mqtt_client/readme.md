# MQTT Client

## Introduction 

This application demonstrates how to configure SiWx91x EVK as MQTT client and how to establish connection with MQTT broker and how to subscribe, publish and receive the MQTT messages from MQTT broker. In this application, SiWx91x EVK is configured as WiFi station and connects to Access Point. After successful WiFi connection, application connects to MQTT broker and subscribes to the topic ***"MQTT_DEMO"*** and publishes a message ***"THIS IS MQTT CLIENT DEMO FROM APPLICATION"*** on that subscribed topic. The application waits to receive the data published on subscribed topic by other clients.

This application uses open source MQTT library which will be present in our host.

IP address of the gateway should also be in long format and in little endian byte order

   Example: To configure "192.168.10.1" as Gateway, update the macro GATEWAY as 0x010AA8C0.

```c
#define GATEWAY                                    0x010AA8C0
```

IP address of the network mask should also be in long format and in little endian byte order.

   Example: To configure "255.255.255.0" as network mask, update the macro NETMASK as 0x00FFFFFF.

```c
#define NETMASK                                    0x00FFFFFF
```

 For running **MQTT** with **SSL**, please enable **TCP_IP_FEAT_SSL** in **rsi_wlan_config.h** file, as shown below. Also load the related **SSL Certificates** in the module using rsi_wlan_set_certificate() API and Need to enable **SSL** flag **RSI_SSL_ENABLE** in rsi_mqtt_connect() API.

## Running the SiWx91x Application
After making any custom configuration changes required, build, download and run the application as below.
1. Configure the Access point in OPEN / WPA-PSK / WPA2-PSK mode to connect SiWx91x EVK in STA mode.

2. To run MQTT broker in Windows PC1, open command prompt and go to MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command: 
```sh
mosquitto.exe â€“p 1883 â€“v
```
![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/image3.png)

3. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on "Advanced" as shown in the below image.
![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/image4.png)

4. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired "TOPIC_NAME" in topic field and click on "ADD". Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on "BACK" as shown in below image.
![Add "TOPIC_NAME" in topic field](resources/readme/image5.png)

5. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on "CONNECT" to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image. 
![MQTT broker Configuration](resources/readme/image6.png)

6. After the program gets executed, the SiWx91x EVK will be connected to the same access point having the configuration same as that of in the application and get IP.

7. Once the SiWx91x EVK gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **RSI_MQTT_TOPIC (Ex: "MQTT_DEMO")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.
![User can see the client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/image7.png)

8. After successful subscription to the topic **RSI_MQTT_TOPIC (Ex: "MQTT_DEMO")**, the SiWx91x EVK publishes a message which is given in **publish_message** array
  (Ex: "THIS IS MQTT CLIENT DEMO FROM APPLICATION") on the subscribed topic.

9. MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.
![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/image8.png)

10. In the MQTT broker, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed topic to that topic. 
![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/image9.png)

11. Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under "Publish" tab, select "raw" data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on "publish". This message will be received by the SiWx91x EVK.
![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/image10.png) 

### 5.4 Procedure For exexcuting the Application when enabled with SSL

1. Configure the Access point in OPEN/WPA-PSK/WPA2-PSK mode to connect Silicon Labs device in STA mode.

2. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC2 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

3. User needs to update the mosquitto.conf file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

4. Also, add "certs" folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

5. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port can be 1883/8883)
   
   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
  ![For opening MQTT server ](resources/readme/image11.png)  

6. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version "tlsv1", just comment the "tls_version tlsv1" in mosquitto.conf file

> Note:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in mosquitto.conf file:
  listener 1883
  allow_anonymous true
> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  "mosquitto -v -p 1883 -c config/mosquitto.conf"
  where config is the sub folder and mosquitto.conf is the different config file than default.
> Limitations: 
> MQTT client application keeps on polling for the data to receive on the subscribed topic irrespective of receive timeout mentioned in the rsi_mqtt_poll_for_recv_data API.

## Observing the output prints on serial terminal

### SoC Mode:
> Connect USB to UART connector Tx and GND pins to WSTK radio board.

   - Connect Tx(Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
   - Connect GND(Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK
