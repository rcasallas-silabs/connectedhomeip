# Embedded MQTT

## 1 Purpose/Scope

This application demonstrates how to SiWx91x is configured as an MQTT client, connects to an MQTT broker, subscribes to a topic and publishes messages on a particular MQTT topic. 
In this application, SiWx91x is configured as a Wi-Fi station and connects to an Access Point. After successful Wi-Fi connection, application connects to a MQTT broker and subscribes to the topic called **MQTT_DEMO**. Subsequently, the application publishes a message **THIS IS MQTT CLIENT DEMO FROM APPLICATION** on the subscribed topic. Finally, the application waits to receive the data published on the subscribed topic by other clients.
This application demonstrates how to configure the SiWx91x EVK as MQTT client and establish connection with MQTT broker and how to subscribe, publish and receive the MQTT messages from MQTT broker.

This application uses MQTT library present in the SiWx91x firmware.

### 4.4.3 Set up for application prints

Before setting up Tera Term, do the following for SoC mode.

**SoC mode**: 
You can use either of the below USB to UART converters for application prints.
1. Set up using USB to UART converter board.

  - Connect Tx (Pin-6) to P27 on WSTK
  - Connect GND (Pin 8 or 10) to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_1.png)**

2. Set up using USB to UART converter cable.

  - Connect RX (Pin 5) of TTL convertor to P27 on WSTK
  - Connect GND (Pin1) of TTL convertor to GND on WSTK

    **![FTDI_prints](resources/readme/usb_to_uart_2.png)**

**Tera Term set up - for NCP and SoC modes**

1. Open the Tera Term tool. 
   - For SoC mode, choose the serial port to which USB to UART converter is connected and click on **OK**. 

     **![UART - SoC](resources/readme/port_selection_soc.png)**

   - For NCP mode, choose the J-Link port and click on **OK**.

     **![J-link - NCP](resources/readme/port_selection.png)**

2. Navigate to the Setup â†’ Serial port and update the baud rate to **115200** and click on **OK**.

    **![Serial port](resources/readme/serial_port_setup.png)**

    **![Baud rate](resources/readme/baud_rate.png)**

### 4.4.4 Execute the application

1. Once the build was successful, right click on project and select **Debug As â†’ Silicon Labs ARM Program** to program the device as shown in below image.

   **![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/program_device.png)**

2. As soon as the debug process is completed, the application control branches to the main().

3. Before running the application, set up the MQTT server on a remote PC. For details, refer to [Appendix](#appendix) section.

4. Click on the **Resume** icon in the Simplicity Studio IDE toolbar to run the application.

   **![Run](resources/readme/run.png)**

5. After the program gets executed, the SiWx91x EVK will be connected to the same access point having the configuration same as that of in the application and get an IP address.

6. Once the SiWx91x gets connected to the MQTT broker, it will subscribe to the topic **RSI_MQTT_TOPIC (Ex: "MQTT_DEMO")**. The user can see the client connected and subscription success information in the MQTT broker.

   **![Client connected and subscription success information](resources/readme/connect_subscribe.png)**

7. After successful subscription to the topic **RSI_MQTT_TOPIC (Ex: "MQTT_DEMO")**, the SiWx91x EVK publishes a message which is given in **publish_message** array
  (Ex: "THIS IS MQTT CLIENT DEMO FROM APPLICATION") on the subscribed topic.

8. MQTT Explorer which is running on Windows PC2 will receive the message published by the SiWx91x EVK as it subscribed to the same topic.

   **![MQTT Explorer receives the message published by the SiWx91x EVK](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

9. In the MQTT broker, user can observe the published message as the MQTT client is subscribed to that topic. 

   **![In MQTT broker, user can observe the published message](resources/readme/publish_msg.png)**

10. Now to publish a message using MQTT Explorer, enter the topic name under **Publish** tab, select **raw** data format, type the data that user wishes to send and then click on **publish**. This message will be received by the SiWx91x.

    **![To publish a message using MQTT Explorer](resources/readme/mqtt_explorer_msg.png)**

**Procedure for executing the application when enabled with SSL**

1. Install MQTT broker in Windows PC1 which is connected to Access Point through LAN.

2. Update the **mosquitto.conf** file with the proper file paths, in which the certificates are available in the mosquitto.conf file.

4. Also, add **certs** folder to the mosquitto broker folder.

5. Execute the following command in MQTT server installed folder. (Ex:  C:\Program Files\mosquitto>mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v) (Port should be 8883)
   
   `mosquitto.exe -c mosquitto.conf -v`  
  
   **![Run MQTTS server](resources/readme/mqtts_server.png)**

6. If you see any error - Unsupported tls_version **tlsv1**, just comment the **tls_version tlsv1** in **mosquitto.conf** file.

**Note**:
> Multiple MQTT client instances can be created.
> If mosquitto isn't allowing external connections to broker, add the below lines in **mosquitto.conf** file:
  ```c
  listener 1883
  allow_anonymous true
  ```
> For using a different config file for mosquitto broker, use command:
  `mosquitto -v -p 1883 -c config/mosquitto.conf`
  where **config** is the sub folder and **mosquitto.conf** is the different config file than default.

## Appendix

### Steps to set up MQTT server

1. To run MQTT broker on port 1883 in Windows PC1, open command prompt and go to MQTT installed folder (Ex: C:\Program Files\mosquitto) and run the following command: 
   ```c
   mosquitto.exe â€“p 1883 â€“v
   ```
   **![Run MQTT broker in Windows PC1](resources/readme/mqtt_server.png)**

2. Open MQTT Explorer in Windows PC2 and delete the existing connections if any and click on **Advanced** as shown in the below image.

   **![Delete the existing connections](resources/readme/delete_connections.png)**

3. Delete the existing topic names if any. Enter the desired **TOPIC_NAME** in topic field and click on **ADD**. Then the desired topic name can be observed in the topic list and click on **BACK** as shown in below image.

   **![Add TOPIC NAME in topic field](resources/readme/add_topic_name.png)**

4. Connect to MQTT broker by giving IP address and port number of Windows PC1 in HOST and PORT fields in MQTT Explorer respectively and click on **CONNECT** to connect to the MQTT broker. If you are running your MQTT broker on the same PC then the following configuration is made as shown in the below image.
