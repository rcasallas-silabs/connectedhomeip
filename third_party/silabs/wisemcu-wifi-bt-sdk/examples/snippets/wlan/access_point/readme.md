### SoC Mode :
![debug_mode_soc](resources/readme/debugmodesoc117.png)
### NCP Mode : 
![debug_mode_NCP](resources/readme/debugmodencp120.png)

### 6.1 Running the SiWx91x Application

- After program gets executed, SiWx91x EVK will be created as an Access Point with configured **SSID** ( Ex: "**SILABS_AP"**) and opens TCP server socket on **DEVICE_PORT** and waits for TCP connection request from TCP client. Now scan and connect to Device Access Point (Ex: "SILABS_AP" is the AP name) from Laptop.

- After successful connection, open iperf application from remote PC command Prompt.

- Connect to TCP Server running on SiWx91x EVK using below command

    `iperf.exe -c <DEVICE_IP> -p <DEVICE_PORT> -i 1 -t 100`

- The SiWx91x EVK accepts connection request and receives data on the TCP server port and exit after receiving configured NUMBER_OF_PACKETS
