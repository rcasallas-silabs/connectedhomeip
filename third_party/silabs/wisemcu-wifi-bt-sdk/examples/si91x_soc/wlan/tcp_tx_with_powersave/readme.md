# **TCP Tx with Powersave**

## **1 Introduction**

This application demonstrates the process for configuring the SiWx91x powersave on periodic wakeup test application power consumption of Silicon device in Connected sleep mode having TCP server socket in open state.

The application creates TCP client socket and then connects to a remote server. After establishing socket connection, TA/NWP is configured in powersave mode, the module Send 512Kb data to TCP Server every 50msec. In this application, TA/NWP is in powersave when data transfer occurs. After completion of data transfer, M4 goes to sleep with configurable alarm time. When the alarm times out, M4 wakes up and in turn NWP/TA is woken up by packet from M4 and flow repeats.

   ![Application configuration](resources/readme/tcptxwithpowersaveapplicationconfiguration.png)

- ### **Wi-Fi Configuration**

    ```c
    //! Wi-Fi Network Name
    #define SSID                       "SILABS_AP"      

    //! Wi-Fi Password
    #define PSK                        "1234567890"     

    //! Wi-Fi Security Type: RSI_OPEN / RSI_WPA / RSI_WPA2
    #define SECURITY_TYPE              RSI_WPA2         
    ```

- ### **Hercules Setup Configuration**

    ```c
      //! The remote TCP server port number on the PC running Hercules Setup
      #define SERVER_PORT              5001              
      
      //! The remote TCP server IP address on the PC running Hercules Setup
      #define SERVER_IP_ADDRESS        "192.168.10.100"  

      //! Number of packets to be transmitted can also be configured
      #define NUMBER_OF_PACKETS        44
    ```

- ### **M4 Alarm time configuration**
    ```c
    #define ALARM_PERIODIC_TIME        300
    ```

- ### **Major Powersave Options**
The primary powersave settings are configured with `PSP_MODE` and `PSP_TYPE`. The default power save mode is set to low power mode 2 (`RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2`) with maximum power save (`RSI_MAX_PSP`) and with M4 based handshake as follows.

```c
  #define PSP_MODE                     RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2
  #define PSP_TYPE                     RSI_MAX_PSP
```

`PSP_MODE` refers to the power save profile mode. SiWx91x EVK supports the following power modes:

  - `RSI_ACTIVE` : In this mode, SiWx91x EVK is active and power save is disabled.
  - `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_1` : In this mode, SiWx91x EVK goes to power save after association with the Access Point. In this sleep mode, SoC will never turn off, therefore no handshake is required before sending data to the SiWx91x EVK.
  - `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2` : In this mode, SiWx91x EVK goes to power save after association with the Access Point. In this sleep mode, SoC will go to sleep based on GPIO hand shake or Message exchange or M4 based handshake, therefore handshake is required before sending data to the SiWx91x EVK.
  - `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8` : In this mode, SiWx91x EVK goes to power save when it is not in associated state with the Access Point. In this sleep mode, SoC will go to sleep based on GPIO handshake or Message exchange or M4 based handshake, therefore handshake is required before sending the command to the SiWx91x EVK.

---- 

**Note!**
  1. For `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2` and `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_8` modes, GPIO or Message or M4 based handshake can be selected using `RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE` macro which is defined in `rsi_wlan_config.h`.
  2. In this example, `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2` can be verified with a M4-based handshake. 

----

`PSP_TYPE` refers to power save profile type. SiWx91x EVK supports following power save profile types:
  - `RSI_MAX_PSP` : In this mode, SiWx91x EVK will be in Maximum power save mode. i.e device will wake up for every DTIM beacon and do data Tx and Rx.
  - `RSI_FAST_PSP` : In this mode, SiWx91x EVK will disable power save for any Tx/Rx packet for monitor interval of time (monitor interval can be set through macro in `rsi_wlan_config.h` file, default value is 50 ms). If there is no data for monitor interval of time, then SiWx91x EVK will again enable power save.
----

**Note!**
  1. `PSP_TYPE` is valid only when `PSP_MODE` is set to `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_1` or `RSI_SLEEP_MODE_2` mode.

----

### Additional Powersave Options
Additional powersave options may be configured in **rsi_wlan_config.h**.
 
```c
  #define CONCURRENT_MODE                     RSI_DISABLE
  #define RSI_FEATURE_BIT_MAP                 (FEAT_SECURITY_OPEN | FEAT_AGGREGATION)
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_BYPASS                   RSI_DISABLE
  #define RSI_TCP_IP_FEATURE_BIT_MAP          (TCP_IP_FEAT_EXTENSION_VALID | TCP_IP_FEAT_DHCPV4_CLIENT)
  #define RSI_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP          FEAT_CUSTOM_FEAT_EXTENTION_VALID
  #define RSI_EXT_CUSTOM_FEATURE_BIT_MAP      (EXT_FEAT_LOW_POWER_MODE | EXT_FEAT_XTAL_CLK_ENABLE)
  #define RSI_EXT_TCPIP_FEATURE_BITMAP        CONFIG_FEAT_EXTENTION_VALID
  #define RSI_BAND                            RSI_BAND_2P4GHZ
  
  The default configuration of low power_save_mode_2 is:
  
  #define RSI_HAND_SHAKE_TYPE                 M4_BASED
  #define PLL_MODE                            0
  #define RF_TYPE                             1  
  #define WIRELESS_MODE                       12 
  #define ENABLE_PPP                          0
  #define AFE_TYPE                            1
  #define FEATURE_ENABLES                    (RSI_FEAT_FRAME_PREAMBLE_DUTY_CYCLE | RSI_FEAT_FRAME_LP_CHAIN | RSI_FEAT_FRAME_IN_PACKET_DUTY_CYCLE)
  #define BUFFER_FULL_HANDLING                0 
```

## **7 Setup for Serial Prints**

To Setup the serial prints, follow the [Setup for Serial Prints]() section in the ***Getting started with SiWx91x SoC*** guide.
  
## **8 Build, Flash, and Run the Application**

To build, flash, and run the application project refer to the [Build and Flash the Project]() section in the ***Getting Started with SiWx91x SoC*** guide.

## **9 Execution Flow**

- Before running the application on SiWx91x, set up the TCP server on remote PC
  - Open a command prompt on the remote PC connected to the Wi-Fi access point.
  - Start a TCP server using the below command in command prompt.
  > `C:\ iperf.exe â€“s -p <SERVER_PORT> -i 1` 

    ![Figure: command prompt on the remote PC](resources/readme/image185.png)
  > If the Iperf server does not start and gives an error in the form of "Access Denied", the user can resolve this error by running the command prompt as an administrator.
- Data transfer can be observed as follows:
    
    ![Figure: TCP packets to the remote peer](resources/readme/image187.png)

- Application prints can be observed as follows

## **10 Application flow**
As the application runs, SiWx91x scans and connects to the Wi-Fi access point and obtains an IP address, socket creation and connection takes place. 
NWP/TA is triggered to sleep with power mode 2 with ram retention, NWP/TA proceeds to transmit packets, for each packet TA is woken up by M4. In this application, NWP/TA is in powersave when data transmission occurs. After transmitting all packets, M4 goes to sleep with configurable alarm time. When the alarm times out, M4 wakes up and in turn NWP/TA is woken up by packet from M4 and flow repeats from socket creation and connection steps.
