# Silicon Labs Matter Repo Overview

Welcome to the Silicon Labs Matter Repo. For more information on Matter in general see the main [Matter Overview](https://www.silabs.com/wireless/matter) page. 

Silicon Labs supports Matter on both 802.15.4 (Thread) and 802.11 (Wi-Fi) transport protocols. 

This Repo is the starting point for all Silicon Labs-related Matter development. In this repo you will find documentation, demos, examples and all the code needed for Matter Accessory Device development on both Thread and Wi-Fi.

The Thread development use cases differs from Wi-Fi because the Thread protocol requires the use of an Open Thread Border Router (OTBR).  

The Thread demo and development use case is described in the Thread section of this documentation located here: [Matter Thread](./thread/DEMO_OVERVIEW.md)

The Wi-Fi demo and development use case is described in the Wi-Fi section of this documentation located here: [Matter Wi-Fi](./wifi/DEMO_OVERVIEW.md)
