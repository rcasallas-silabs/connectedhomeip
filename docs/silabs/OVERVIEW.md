# Silicon Labs Matter Repo Overview

Welcome to the Silicon Labs Matter Repo. For more information on Matter in general please checkout the main Matter Overview page located here [Matter Overview](../../README.md)

Silicon Labs supports Matter on both 802.15.4 (Thread) and 802.11 (Wifi) transport protocols. 

This Repo is the starting point for all Silicon Labs related Matter development. In this repo you will find documentation, demos, examples and all the code needed for Matter Accessory Device development on both Thread and Wifi.

The Thread and Wifi development use cases differ because the Thread protocol requires the use of an Open Thread Border Router (OTBR).

The Thread development use case is described in the Thread section of this documentation located here: [Matter Thread](./thread/THREAD.md)

The Wifi development use case is described in the Wifi section of this documentation located here: [Matter Wifi](./wifi/WIFI.md)
