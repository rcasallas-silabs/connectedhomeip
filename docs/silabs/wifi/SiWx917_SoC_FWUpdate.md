## Steps to update the firmware on SiWx917 SoC radio board using Tera Term
1. Connect power cable to radio board.
    
2. Jumper should be connected.

3. Switches: Left switch should be **ON/high**, and the right switch should be on the **ISP** side.

4. Open Tera term in windows PC and check for connected USB devices.

5. Select JLink CDC UART Port and change baud rate to 921600 to increase speed.

6. From terminal type "CTRL + |" for boot message "U", then type "U" for boot menu, type "B", "0" to burn wireless / "4", "1" to burn MCU firmware, and give (Ctrl + \ + c) to exit from kermit.
