# Building Your Wi-Fi Matter End Device and the Chip-Tool

## Compiling the Lighting-app

The following commands are for building the example. Depending on which device
you are using, select the appropriate build command to run.

> Please note that these examples reference a specific board the BRD4161A. You
> may be using a different board like the BRD4186C, please change the board
> referenced in the build command to your specific board before running the
> command.

Build command for RS911x + EFR32MG12:

> `$ ./scripts/examples/gn_efr32_example.sh examples/lighting-app/efr32/ out/rs911x_lighting BRD4161A --wifi rs911x |& tee out/rs911x_lighting.out`

Build command for WF200 + EFR32MG12:

> `$ ./scripts/examples/gn_efr32_example.sh examples/lighting-app/efr32/ out/wf200_lighting BRD4161A is_debug=false --wifi wf200 |& tee out/rs911x_lighting.out`

Build command for RS911x + EFR32MG24:

> `$ ./scripts/examples/gn_efr32_example.sh examples/lighting-app/efr32/ out/rs911x_mg24_lighting BRD4186C disable_lcd=true show_qr_code=false use_external_flash=false --wifi rs911x`

Build command for WF200 + EFR32MG24:

> `$ ./scripts/examples/gn_efr32_example.sh examples/lighting-app/efr32/ out/rs911x_mg24_lighting BRD4186C disable_lcd=true show_qr_code=false use_external_flash=false --wifi wf200`

Run the following:

> `$ cd matter`

> `$ <appropriate_build_command_from_above>`

<br>

> Look for build problems in `out/*.out`, which is the log file that was
> generated by the above command

The generated software can be found in `out/rs911x_xxx/BRD4161A/*.out`.

This is what you will flash into the EFR32.

## Compiling Chip-Tool

-   Build the ChipTool on a laptop which has Wi-Fi and Bluetooth LE
-   Run the following commands:

    > `$ cd $MATTER_WORKDIR/matter` <br>

    > `$ ./scripts/examples/gn_build_example.sh examples/chip-tool out/standalone`

    This will build chiptool in `out/standalone`

Now you have all the binaries to flash onto the Silicon Labs platform (MG12,
MG24, etc...). For more information on how to flash a Silicon Labs device please
consult the [Flashing Silicon Labs Device](../general/FLASH_SILABS_DEVICE.md)
page.
